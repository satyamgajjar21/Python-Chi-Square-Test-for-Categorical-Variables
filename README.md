# Chi-Square Test for Categorical Variables

The chi-square test is a non-parametric method used to assess whether two categorical variables are statistically associated. You‚Äôll often see it in market research, healthcare studies, social science surveys, and quality-control analyses.

## Introduction

The chi-square test determines if an observed frequency distribution of a categorical variable significantly differs from an expected distribution under the assumption of independence.

---

## Concept

- **Non-parametric**: Makes no assumptions about underlying population distributions.  
- **Contingency table**: Organize observed counts for each combination of categories.  
- **Expected counts**: Computed under the null hypothesis of independence.

---

## Hypotheses

- **Null (H‚ÇÄ)**: The two categorical variables are independent; any difference between observed and expected counts is due to chance.  
- **Alternative (H‚ÇÅ)**: There is an association between the variables; observed counts deviate more than would be expected by chance.
